    <h1>Potato Information</h1>
    <div id="info-container">
        
            <p>Potatoes are starchy root vegetables that belong to the Solanaceae family. They are one of the most widely consumed and versatile crops globally. Potatoes are valued for their nutritional content, culinary flexibility, and storage capability.</p>

            <h2>Growing Conditions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes are cool-season crops that thrive in moderate climates.</li>
                <li>They require well-drained soil with a pH level between 5.0 and 6.0.</li>
                <li>The ideal temperature range for their growth is between 60°F and 70°F (15°C to 21°C).</li>
                <li>They need full sun exposure for optimal growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Varieties</h2>
            <p>There are numerous potato varieties available, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Russet</li>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Yukon Gold</li>
                <li>Fingerling</li>
                <li>Purple potatoes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Planting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes are typically grown from seed potatoes.</li>
                <li>They can be planted directly in the ground or in containers.</li>
                <li>The planting depth should be around 4-6 inches (10-15 cm).</li>
                <li>The spacing between plants should be approximately 12-15 inches (30-38 cm).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Crop Care</h2>
            <p>Proper care is essential for successful potato cultivation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular watering is necessary, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li>Hilling helps promote tuber development and protects the potatoes from sunlight.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
            <p>Potatoes are susceptible to various pests and diseases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common pests include potato beetles, aphids, and nematodes.</li>
                <li>Diseases like late blight, early blight, and potato scab can affect the crop.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Harvesting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes are typically ready for harvest when the plants have flowered and the foliage starts to
                    yellow and die back.</li>
                <li>Carefully dig around the plant to avoid damaging the tubers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dry, and dark place with good ventilation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ideal storage temperature ranges from 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C).</li>
                <li>Avoid storing potatoes near onions, as the gases released by onions can cause potatoes to spoil
                    faster.</li>
            </ul>
