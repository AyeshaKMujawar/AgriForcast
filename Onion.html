        <!-- <h1>Onion Crop Information</h1> -->
        <p>Onions are bulbous vegetables that belong to the Allium genus. They are widely cultivated and consumed around
            the world for their distinctive flavor and culinary uses. Onions come in different varieties, including
            yellow onions, red onions, and white onions. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or used as a flavoring
            ingredient in various dishes. Onions are known for their pungent aroma and are rich in nutrients like
            vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants.</p>

        <h2>Growing Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Onions are cool-season crops that can be grown in a wide range of climates.</li>
            <li>They prefer well-drained soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
            <li>The ideal temperature range for their growth is between 55°F and 75°F (13°C to 24°C).</li>
            <li>They require full sun exposure for optimal growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Varieties</h2>
        <p>There are numerous onion varieties available, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow onions</li>
            <li>Red onions</li>
            <li>White onions</li>
            <li>Sweet onions</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Onions are typically grown from onion sets or seeds.</li>
            <li>They can be planted directly in the ground or in containers.</li>
            <li>The planting depth should be around 1 inch (2.5 cm) for sets or ¼ to ½ inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) for seeds.
            </li>
            <li>The spacing between plants should be approximately 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crop Care</h2>
        <p>Proper care is essential for successful onion cultivation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular watering is necessary, especially during dry periods.</li>
            <li>Onions are shallow-rooted, so weeds should be controlled to prevent competition.</li>
            <li>Applying mulch can help conserve moisture and suppress weed growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
        <p>Onions are susceptible to various pests and diseases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Common pests include onion thrips, onion maggots, and onion fly.</li>
            <li>Diseases like onion downy mildew, onion white rot, and onion smut can affect the crop.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Harvesting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Onions are typically ready for harvest when the tops have fallen over and started to dry.</li>
            <li>Gently lift the onions from the ground and allow them to dry in a well-ventilated area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>Onions should be stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid storing onions near potatoes, as the gases released by potatoes can cause onions to spoil faster.
            </li>
            <li>Onions can be stored in mesh bags or in a well-ventilated container.</li>
            <li>Store them away from direct sunlight to prevent sprouting.</li>
        </ul>
